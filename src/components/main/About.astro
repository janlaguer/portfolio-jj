    My first taste for coding and web development was on Visual Basic and HTML
    during a random computer class. Soon after I started exploring different
    languages and fell in the hole that is web development.
    <br /><br />
    Today, I am a graduate student whose thesis was to create a system to get data
    from a game and visualize that data depending on the current event for esports
    - similar to sports broadcasts. I love building things that solve problems for
    even the nichest of areas.

    While I'm not VSCode, you can find me playing badminton, reading, listening to
    music, or screaming and laughing with my friends on the many different games
    we play.
