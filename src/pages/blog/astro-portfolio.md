Making a portfolio is something that most developers will have to do. To both
have a place to view all of their previous works and to have a product to
showcase the culmination of their learning.

I want to give my two cents and say Astro is great to use for this type of use
case.

## What a Portfolio Brings to the Table

Like what I mentioned previously, a portfolio serves as a place to easily view a
developers previous works and to showcase what a developer is capable of. While
any other framework could easily do the former, Astro positions the developer to
excel in the latter.

If we're just going to focus on the first reason, there really isn't a method
that is any better than the other. You can make your entire portfolio in
Next.js, Sveltekit, Nuxt.js, or even just straight HTML + CSS + JS.

## Why Astro?

Developers over the years have been exposed to many different ways of coding
their UI and because they have been exposed to the idea of using the right tool
for the right job, they aren't always sticking to one tech stack.

> I should use React here to make the website feel like an application. Vue
> would be good here since I need to focus on performance.

Developers have slowly built up their _bat-belt_ of technologies. Then here
comes Astro to tell the developers: "Hey! You don't need to keep using that
hammer since you have a drill".

What makes Astro unique from the rest is that it's **Framework/Library
agnostic**. By default, it doesn't ship JS to the user, making it a static site
generator. It is possible,however, to have interactivity in select places in
your website which is called Islands by Astro. The fun thing about these islands
is that you can use any Framework or Library to get that interactivity.

### Why This Matters

In just this one website, you can prove your decision making skills by choosing
the right tools for the right job. You're also able to showcase that you know
how to style and code in different languages. Astro is also great for search
engine optimization since it is the static site generator.

## Only Technical People Would Get This

For the normal user, they'll just see a normal portfolio unaware of the
different technologies you used. They'll be more impressed by the content than
the methods you used...

**AND THAT'S THE POINT**

That situation is so much better than a user clicking away because the site took
too long to load or giving up on the navigation because there's just too much
happening in the background unbeknownst to them. Astro lets you eliminate all of
the slow parts and only have it on parts where you really need it.

## Conclusion

I said Astro was better because it lets developers to showcase what they are
capable of. I wrote that its because we're able to use the right tools for the
right job. Not because we can showcase all the different stuff we know but
because Astro makes the content the hero. It prevents Javascript so that those
that visit the website aren't frustrated because of problems stemming from
Javascript.

At the end of the day, your portfolio isn't just about you but about presenting
_you_ to others
